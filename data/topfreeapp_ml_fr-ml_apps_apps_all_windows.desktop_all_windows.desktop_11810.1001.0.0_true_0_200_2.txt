This is a published centennial application. All Credit to the original Notepad++ team, all the heavy lifting of creating an awesome app was done by them.\r\n\r\nThis is currently Notepad++ version 7.5.9 (updated in this update)\r\n\r\nCode and changes required for publishing is located here: https://github.com/NightRi-se/notepad-plus-plus\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n1.   Default Plugins can not be removed or updated\r\n2.   Custom plugins CAN NOT be loaded AT ALL on Windows 10 S (on other versions of windows, it is possible to load them from %appdata% - but ensure your plugin version matches your build version [x86/x64]).\r\n\r\nWe are working on including a selection of plugins by default for future versions. Current we have included MarkdownViewer++ and Compare plugins by default.\r\n\r\nNotepad++ is a free (free as in both \"free speech\" and \"free beer\") source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several programming languages and natural languages.

It is said that al-Bukhari collected over 300,000 hadith and included only 2,602 traditions in his Sahih.\r\n\r\nThe book covers almost all aspects of life in providing proper guidance of Islam such as the method of performing prayers and other actions of worship directly from the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Bukhari finished his work around 846, and spent the last twenty-four years of his life visiting other cities and scholars, teaching the hadith he had collected. \r\n\r\nIn every city that Bukhari visited, thousands of people would gather in the main mosque to listen to him recite traditions.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDJXP4","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Xodo PDF Reader & Editor","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58738.9007199266505325.bafe84dc-3149-47b8-9f02-0a0bf3564f21.c1df2d5c-9973-4261-a236-27d19718a46a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1793.9007199266505325.bafe84dc-3149-47b8-9f02-0a0bf3564f21.06a396f6-ad4f-4d3c-9697-2213d3a50771","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30284.9007199266505325.bafe84dc-3149-47b8-9f02-0a0bf3564f21.cfd62657-eb4e-4cb2-b2db-894199abb93c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14871.9007199266505325.bafe84dc-3149-47b8-9f02-0a0bf3564f21.b6d0c212-8971-45a1-9427-51e0876f4e07","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41041.9007199266505325.bafe84dc-3149-47b8-9f02-0a0bf3564f21.7a87c823-4cb7-41c2-9e49-39d58da4792a","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55271.9007199266505325.bafe84dc-3149-47b8-9f02-0a0bf3564f21.b461dfd0-a10d-429b-ac7f-c630a767d924","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11486.9007199266505325.bafe84dc-3149-47b8-9f02-0a0bf3564f21.1aa14a62-57f2-4b95-84c3-2a027470b36d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7059.9007199266505325.bafe84dc-3149-47b8-9f02-0a0bf3564f21.560c8062-6af0-4113-af9e-f69afc29c27f","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61807.9007199266505325.bafe84dc-3149-47b8-9f02-0a0bf3564f21.028c43ee-3099-407f-b25e-873eba753f52","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratuit","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["5E8FC25E.XodoDocs_3v3sf0k6w2rec"],"ContentIds":["0987b029-786d-7ac6-6af1-ff126241d6b7","b2e14632-d7e4-fb1f-68b1-79026cbbcb36","66fe3d66-21cd-5ffb-cf47-2f46fefd095f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Xodo PDF Reader is an all-in-one PDF reader and PDF editor\r\n• Free!

Dans ce cas, installez sans tarder eBook Search.\r\n\r\nC’est comme disposer d’un accès privilégié à la plus grande librairie du monde, aux rayons surchargés par plus de 2 millions de livres, et ouverte 24 heures sur 24, 7 jours sur 7. \r\n\r\nOù que vous soyez, à vous prélasser au bord de la piscine, dans un café Starbucks, ou dans la salle d’attente d’un aéroport, vous ne serez jamais à court d’un bon livre à lire.\r\n\r\nIl vous suffira de feuilleter les catalogues d’eBook Search, de choisir un livre et de taper une ou deux fois sur l’écran pour pouvoir vous lancer dans la lecture de ce livre sur votre lecteur eBook préféré : Kindle, Nook, ou PDF Reader (ou la plupart des autres application de lecteur)… À vous de choisir.\r\n\r\neBook Search utilise une source peu connue de livres de littérature classique et propose des auteurs tels que Jane Austen ou Mark Twain. Tous ces livres que vous vous étiez promis de lire « un jour ou l’autre ».\r\n\r\nN’attendez plus ce jour. Grâce à eBook Search, vous pourrez retrouver tous les livres que vous auriez voulu lire, et découvrir au bout de vos doigts tout un univers de littérature inexploré. Et eBook Search propose bien plus que des livres classiques.\r\n\r\nVous aurez à disposition un grand nombre d’histoires contemporaines, y compris des romans policiers, des livres fantastiques ou des livres de science-fiction. Quelles que soient vos préférences en matière de lecture, vous allez découvrir une sélection impressionnante. Et vous pourrez tomber, pour votre plus grand plaisir, sur des livres exceptionnels dont vous n’aurez jamais entendu parler auparavant.\r\n\r\nTous ces moments perdus que vous auriez pu mettre à profit « si seulement vous aviez emporté un livre », seront désormais, grâce à eBook Search, des heures de plaisir.\r\n\r\nQui plus est, vous pouvez lire ces ouvrages sur n’importe quel lecteur eBook. Reader, Kindle, Nook, PDF Reader, ou presque toute autre application, selon vos préférences. Inutile d'apprendre à utiliser le tout dernier modèle de lecteur eBook. eBook Search transfère le livre que vous aurez choisi directement sur votre application eBook préférée.\r\n\r\nMais venons-en au meilleur. Chaque livre que vous obtenez sur eBook Search, et il vous faudra choisir parmi plus de 2 millions d'ouvrages, est absolument gratuit.\r\n\r\nAlors que vos amis déboursent leur argent pour un eBook acheté auprès d’un grand libraire (et se plaignent du prix exorbitant réclamé pour un livre que l’on ne peut même pas tenir entre nos mains), vous aurez de votre côté accès à une quantité de livres impressionnante… et pour lesquels vous n’aurez pas à verser un centime.\r\n\r\nAlors que vos amis vont payer “Le Chien des Baskervilles” 9,33$, vous pourrez le lire gratuitement. Alors que vos amis vont verser 14,93$ pour “Tom Sawyer”, le vôtre sera gratuit. Et ce sera la même chose pour les romans policiers, les romans d’amour, de science-fiction et bien d’autres.\r\n\r\nC’est à vous de voir. Vous pouvez continuer à gaspiller votre argent dans les livres que propose la concurrence (inutile de les nommer). Ou bien choisir de garder vos sous et d’accéder, grâce à eBook Search, à 2 millions de livres gratuits.\r\n\r\nC’est

We wanted to do the same thing. Unfortunately, we found that using an MP3 player or iPhone for this purpose was very awkward. We would often start the wrong song or have a hard time seeing the song titles. It was also a chore to \"train\" teammates to be the \"D.J.\" \r\n\r\nThe solution:\r\nThis app solves this problem. Each of the buttons is large and easy to see. You can pick the correct song each time, no matter how big your fingers are. Since the songs are named and organized in the filesystem, not the app, there is no data entry or creating of playlists required. The fades are very professional.\r\n\r\nWINDOWS STORE EXCLUSIVE","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDR0SF","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"One Calendar","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49190.9007199266538018.100f6778-8fbb-455b-91f6-db7fabe98246.ae32a4d7-4e18-40ce-8fbf-1c4f9ee5d027","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55864.9007199266538018.100f6778-8fbb-455b-91f6-db7fabe98246.d5b8e0e7-53ac-4a60-9f64-a826a29defb8","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratuit⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["64885BlueEdge.OneCalendar_8kea50m9krsh2"],"ContentIds":["d5a560bc-c6a6-48ab-d00e-5d27aee880b9","ca82cbc6-975a-f9c0-7632-ba1b42e447f5"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"L'application la plus populaire pour afficher tous vos calendriers tels que vos calendriers Google, Outlook, Live, Exchange ou Office365 ainsi que vos événements Facebook.

Easy on CPU and memory.\r\nIMPORTANT: uBlock Origin is completely unrelated to the site \"ublock.org\".\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAn efficient blocker: easy on memory and CPU footprint, and yet can load and enforce thousands more filters than other popular blockers out there.\r\n\r\nUsage: The big power button in the popup is to permanently disable/enable uBlock Origin for the current web site. It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nFlexible, it's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\r\n\r\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\r\n\r\n- EasyList\r\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\r\n- EasyPrivacy\r\n- Malware domains\r\n\r\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\r\n\r\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\r\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\r\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\r\n- MVPS HOSTS\r\n- Spam404\r\n- And many others\r\n\r\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\r\n\r\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nFree.\r\nOpen source with
