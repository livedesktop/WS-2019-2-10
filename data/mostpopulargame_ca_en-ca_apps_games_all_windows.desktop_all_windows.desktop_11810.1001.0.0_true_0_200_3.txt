It is a detective story rich with horror, plot twists, and shadowy intrigue.\r\n\r\nA year has passed since the events of Maple Creek. But for the past few months, our detective has been hot on the trail of the demonic preacher she fought one year ago. Yet he has managed to always stay one step ahead. \r\n\r\nShe hoped to bring an end to the chase in the redwood forests of Northern California. But like so many times before, the trail went cold… \r\n\r\nThen she encountered an abandoned camper in the middle of the highway. Enormous claw marks scored the roof and the lost family’s personal belongings were scattered everywhere. All signs pointed to the scene being fresh. \r\n\r\nAnd all clues led into nearby Ravenwood Park…\r\n\r\nWalking through the park gates, the detective feels the weight of invisible eyes watching. Sinister shadows lurk behind the park’s enchanting scenery and the wary glances of its overly-polite employees. Is this place connected to Maple Creek, and the preacher? \r\n\r\nWho is the mysterious prisoner she meets on the forest path – someone stalking her every move, or a possible ally? Is she merely a puppet being used in forces from outside our world, or will she finally resolve the evil events that began one year before?","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Your car is prepared, the road is clear and your only limit is yourself… are you burning inside? Are you furious enough? \r\n\r\nFurious driving is an adrenaline-driven racing game where you fight against the clock to get as far as possible inside your car. As the wheeled fury, you have the glory in your hands: compete against other players’ score getting further than them, avoid the obstacles which will delay you and cross every checkpoint in time. Remember, your skill is everything: FD comes with a challenging achievement system where your ability will be put into true test - crash the boring police, be faster than anyone, climb to the top score and show the world who you are. \r\n\r\nOn top of the awesome gameplay, Furious driving is a delight to your senses: 4K textures ready for retina display, which will not penalize your gameplay - the speed feeling is assured and you will almost be able to feel the wind in your face. The graphics are customizable for the lesser powerful machines so you can sacrifice beauty for speed. Three completely different scenarios come within the game: the great Alps, the military base in the desert and the labyrinthine downtown, where not the shortest path is the finest… and of course, with 5 different cars which will completely change the driving experience.

Dogs are the most devoted friends. You can teach your cute puppy different commands. You can play ball, travel, and just take care of it. Dogs also have a great nose and are the best detectives! In exchange for their service, each dog dreams about a tasty bone! In this coloring book, you will find exciting scenes from the life of dogs of various breeds.\n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1JK45","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Par 72 Golf IV","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47138.13510798885982998.534ebe02-ccfa-4253-b15a-6482c033a786.7302865e-c8ce-49dd-bbb7-ad803edc11fd","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#0985d5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46176.13510798885982998.cf4280a7-49bb-4d95-b235-bcf480339a0a.a830def8-4156-4550-9063-36f677b1a7d4","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#0985d5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $6.49","Price":6.49,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["28861RESETgame.Par72GolfIV_35b8x47qztent"],"ContentIds":["c57a5ecf-4863-4709-6d45-9c0648543e7f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Par 72 Golf is a realistic 3D golf game featuring three 18 hole courses set in mountain, desert, and seaside environments.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MX969783VKN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Uno Classic","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56993.13894160902856357.9e1c5cbb-c9a4-4fa0-a539-decbe20243e0.421ce040-3e88-4192-bb2b-9ac9f15a0dbc","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57706.13894160902856357.9e1c5cbb-c9a4-4fa0-a539-decbe20243e0.b0306bcd-a183-4fe5-9698-b9548517dcab","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16998.13894160902856357.b3de4123-d4df-40bc-bd2f-e5c63350b85d.7ccac983-6f50-4258-9cab-74ccab14ddc5","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["61643PlayEverydayGames.UnoClassic_fvk8tmxh6cs7a"],"ContentIds":["e9aa04f5-f068-0fac-40c3-81f65cd4e5a5","497fc598-d9fe-3af3-cd62-94cf51c85e06"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Uno Classic is a fast and frenzied card game has been a family favorite for over four decades now.

The memories still burn deeply, like spicy chicken wings.\r\n\r\n\"They came without warning, squawking menacingly, their ruffled feathers darkening the sun. Invading intergalactic chickens, out to punish humanity for our oppression of their earthly brethren.\r\n\r\n\"I instantly knew what had to be done. I dropped my half-eaten chicken burger and jumped in my cockpit. With a greasy finger I set my lasers to \"extra crispy\" and blasted off to intercept the fowl invaders.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't easy. Squawks, feathers flying, the smell of charred chicken everywhere. Three times they invaded, each time with increasingly devious plans. Three times I managed to push them back whence they came, and secure humanity a few more years as the dominant species of this planet.\r\n\r\n\"After their last retreat, I headed for my local Space Burger to bask in the glow of my recent victory. Breathing a sigh of relief, I sat down to enjoy a double chicken-burger with crispy chicken wings on the side.\r\n\r\n\"Little did I know that my greatest adventure was yet to come...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ultimate Omelette\" is the title of the fourth episode in the Chicken Invaders series of casual space shooter games. The game puts players at the forefront of a battle against invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for our oppression of Earth chickens. In this episode, the chickens have constructed a gigantic cannon capable of launching planet-scale eggs against Earth, with the ultimate goal of encrusting humanity in an impenetrable wall made of egg white. Joined by an unlikely ally, players will travel to foreign, unexplored galaxies in an effort to locate and destroy the egg cannon before it reaches Earth.\r\n\r\nThe enemy repertoire has been significantly broadened, introducing several different kinds of chickens which attack relentlessly in colorful groups and meticulously choreographed formations. The chicken fray is punctuated by fights against boss enemies spanning up to three times the size of the screen. The arsenal at the player's disposal has also been correspondingly extended, with three new weapons and four kinds of supporting satellites providing additional firepower. The player's intergalactic journey is also accentuated by unique fantastic scenarios, such as navigating through a field of gigantic floating feathers, or dodging molten planet chunks during a supernova explosion.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDDTJ5","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Sudoku For Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50969.9007199266403182.28e34dae-8282-44e0-a0ed-3235016e7820.ec6e91ea-08f0-4385-ba4c-1fb294beb29a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#f8d990","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6115.9007199266403182.c257b920-054b-4050-859c-1e143a062474.9f813a6b-8102-435d-ab9d-da69db5ceb99","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#f8d990","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.1,"RatingsCount":"13","PackageFamilyNames":["ArkadiumLabs.SudokuForFree_0wzk3fg68w9ze"],"ContentIds":["882038c0-0436-4d40-4cba-fce9aa66b2ae"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Love logic puzzles?

The interactive objects can be used for learning landing and precise model control. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the fixed point camera that represents the RC pilot point of view, we have included follow up camera that allows for walking behind the model.

This isn't a shoot-em-up, just a laid-back, enjoyable way to learn how to play poker. Relax and have fun!\r\n\r\nAnnie, Cowboy, Gambler, and The Kid are four wisecracking card sharks who will try to take your money!\r\n\r\nEach player has his own unique style of play - and playing against those styles, combined with the Hints and context-based Strategy, should help you learn how to play poker. \r\n\r\nPlayers:\r\nAnnie: Annie is no stranger to these tables and she is much tougher than she looks. To her, poker is much more than a game, its how she makes her living. If you're not careful, she will take your money in a big hurry! She doesn't like to lose so she'll fold on a weak hand but bet hard on a strong one.\r\n\r\nCowboy: The Cowboy is a tough one to figure out. Maybe he's had a tough day and is distracted. Maybe he's just not very good at poker. Sometimes he'll fold on a good hand and bluff a bad one. However, if he has a really good hand, he'll usually bet.\r\n\r\nKid: The Kid is in town looking for a good time. He has money to burn and has been in the Casino a bit too long. His loose and passive play can be irritating. He'll make a mistake or two but be careful, he can fool you into losing your money!\r\n\r\nGambler: The Gambler is a bona fide \"shark\" and knows the odds. He is here for one reason only - to take your money! He plays tight and aggressive which means he'll usually bet on a hand he thinks can win. If he doesn't think he'll win a hand, he'll fold so be careful when he decides to bet. He'll bluff every now and then, just to keep you on your toes.\r\n\r\nLearn to Play:\r\nYou have many options for hints and strategy.

First we get acquainted with domestic animals, like for example, fluffy kittens and playful dogs. On the street, we come across small insects and chirping, spotted birds. In the zoo we can view wild animals, such as rabbits, a fox, and a bear. Every time we learn more and more about these co-habitants of our Earth! Some of them creep along, while others run on their paws; still others soar through the air! Some prefer to live in burrows, some in nests, while others just live in the trees or sleep in meadows. You'll see huge elephants and hippopotamuses, small chameleons and frogs, fast lions and slow turtles - herbivores and predators alike. We invite you to get acquainted with these marvelous representatives of the animal kingdom on the pages of our game!  \r\n\r\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \r\nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\r\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\r\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDQZMB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Shiny The Firefly","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.6697.9007199266539087.3b50337d-837e-403c-9ec3-406ba64954dd.d2813208-c13a-49fb-aa02-882e2914977c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.38491.9007199266539087.0834c58d-f907-4c88-a9fb-c96a78d85145.5e09c516-047b-4814-87ff-23a4232870f6","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $3.89","Price":3.89,"AverageRating":4.7,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["HeadupGamesGmbHCo.KG.ShinyTheFirefly_zjj3tfjabet3j"],"ContentIds":["85468d5f-acaf-0629-7f9f-596484622715","a7806c8f-d95c-8686-3aa3-31893eee19a7"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This adorable game, set in the middle of a picturesque garden, has you helping Shiny, the cute little firefly, to find his babies.

A series of exciting sound effects punctuates your child's taps and salutes them with uplifting chimes each time the problem is successfully completed, an option parents can customize within the app's preferences menu.\r\n\r\nThe game's activities help the children develop the following basic numbers and arithmetic skills:\r\n\r\nCounting\r\n\r\nChildren can learn their numbers from 1 to 20 by counting up, or down, using the app's large, kid-friendly back and forward buttons.\r\n\r\n{Parents can choose to have the numbers spoken in one of eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese) and set the numbers to appear sequentially or randomly.}\r\n\r\nRecognizing and Comparing Numbers\r\n\r\nTwo activities specifically encourage your child's number comparison and recognition skills: Find the Largest Number and Find the Smallest Number. With each game, a series of hot air balloons descend from the top of the screen and bob up and down. The narrator encourages the child to pick the balloon with the largest or the smallest number.\r\n\r\nThe constant motion and varying number of the balloons, from two to four, along with the large number range, from 1 to 99, promotes concentration and quick thinking.\r\n\r\nFinding a Match\r\n\r\nParents can encourage their child's memory skills with the Find a Match game. Based on the classic turn-over tile memory game format, children are prompted to find the matching numbers hiding beneath a field of cloud-shaped tiles. The number of clouds can be set in the context menu for this activity.\r\n\r\nLearning Addition and Subtraction\r\n\r\nTwo activities guide children through the basics of addition and subtraction using apples and pears, and a third, advanced exercise, combines the two.\r\n\r\nChildren are given a problem to solve, four answer choices, and visual clues to help them find the right answer.\r\n\r\nThe advanced exercise provides a series of combined addition and subtraction problems with numerals ranging from 1 to 99. The multiple choice format of the addition and subtraction games stays the same, but this activity eliminates visual references--no orchard fruit to help your child figure out the right answer.\r\n\r\nIf you want your child to learn math--and enjoy it--you'll love Kids Numbers and Math, and so will your little one!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDRB2W","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Free Tower Defence","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3469.9007199266546304.49b8e82d-7992-4c22-88f9-3f6d7fa82196.030451b6-f64a-4e6f-950f-6e9cefdc6cfd","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5429.9007199266546304.eb0cba38-3cb9-4d15-b387-be4885537fd2.5499e477-ffa7-45e7-acb8-9e3c42dc615b","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38172.9007199266546304.38282eb4-9b9a-4bfb-bdcd-23c0d2e64c3e.6d23583e-23c5-4755-9f4c-3dea64f45a4a","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46219.9007199266546304.5020fa33-2539-4dbd-a7a7-54c8e852c3d7.1a76f00f-47f4-4afc-8649-84880ea5d3c6","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42919.9007199266546304.a0423632-2756-45a3-b1dd-b2392ea4af52.4c667bb5-5db6-4969-88c0-61f755a646f8","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9775.9007199266546304.c4b6184d-3016-43a1-82d9-8a188522a0fc.67afbca0-31bc-4670-8811-b1a569b63a53","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.5,"RatingsCount":"8","PackageFamilyNames":["19363BlueskyStudio.FreeTowerDefence_ad90gx91p0mxj"],"ContentIds":["96922850-5b86-7809-f00b-2a84645c9be1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Build weapons and barriers freely to construct your unbeatable tower defence.

You ride in outdoor locations on a time-based race. The goal is to complete each round as fast as possible, but World Enduro Rally will give you bonus time if you perform stunts like backflips, frontflips (and other hidden stunts), and will add penalty time each time you re-spawn.\r\n\r\nEnduro bikes are heavy, and controlling tilt is sometimes hard. They don't brake much either, so you need to plan your speed carefully. The game includes speed signs to give you tips about when you can drive fast, or when you should drive slowly. \r\n\r\nMore bikes and locations will keep coming! \r\n\r\nWe’re on Twitter (@WEnduroRally) and Facebook (@worldEnduroRally).","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCS7","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Backgammon Gold FREE","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1354.9007199266251476.1fb929ea-e92b-4b88-9aa8-a807b420dec6.08c29251-de1a-43dc-8cb3-c38c218b2974","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25032.9007199266251476.d9851005-42be-4e54-bbec-636030120df6.016a51ab-3e55-432c-b7a6-0dbf0e1109a0","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.6,"RatingsCount":"47","PackageFamilyNames":["mobiventionGmbH.BackgammonGoldFREE_m1mjrb5ek7e8a"],"ContentIds":["6f960000-42c5-8613-19cf-58d5d11f9688"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Backgammon Gold - lots of exciting and extendable features such as tournaments, help functions, difficulty levels and game variations will take you into the world of one of the oldest and best-known board games.\r\n\r\nBackgammon Gold comes in a cool design for FREE!\r\n\r\nTHE FEATURES:\r\n- 2 players \r\n- Single game & tournament\r\n- Classic & Nackgammon\r\n- 100% fair dice rolls with Live Rolls function\r\n- 4 board designs\r\n- 3 difficulty levels\r\n- Automatic moves for fast gaming\r\n- Double dice deactivation\r\n- Save games\r\n- Confirm move function\r\n- Redo function\r\n\r\nBUY ADDITIONALLY:\r\n- Beginners computer opponent from BGBlitz - the international rewarded Backgammon software\r\n- Professionals computer opponent from BGBlitz- the international rewarded Backgammon software\r\n- No advertisements\r\n- 8 additional board designs\r\n- The BGBlitz Tutor to learn the perfect move\r\n- Full version at a reduced price\r\n\r\nGet Backgammon Gold now and show your opponent how to play properly!\r\n\r\nOur gamers say:\r\n***** \"Finally a challenging KI in an appealing design.\"\r\n***** \"The best Backgammon of all!\"\r\n***** \"A game everybody knows and which makes lots of fun.\"\r\n***** \"I'm very happy and play it often with my girlfriend.

This girl likes to explore things, likes to see something new and enjoys adventures so much. At this moment she is in Egypt. Actually she is in the south part of Egypt, near the city known as Luxor, in the area Abul Nagaa. She has come there because she believes that the ancient tombs in this place are not sufficiently explored. She thinks that the tombs are actually forgotten and someone has to see what is hiding there.\r\n\r\nDuring her visit to the tombs in Luxor, Nicole realizes that he was right in her assumptions because very soon she starts discovering new things. Namely, she starts finding a lot of valuable objects including eight mummies undiscovered until now. This seems like a really important discovery but the findings don't stop here. Additionally Nicole discovers small statues that weren't found before in Egypt or on any other place around the world. She knows that her discovery is huge so she goes more into details and continues exploring every possible place really carefully.\r\n\r\nLet's look around together with Nicole and see what those tombs hide.

It is played between two or more players on a gameboard having numbered squares. Several \"ladders\" and \"snakes\" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares.\r\n\r\nThis game can be player by minimum 2 and maximum 4 players. The names of players should be mention in first screen.\r\n\r\n1) The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach the end by moving across the board from square one to the final square. \r\nFollow the numbers on the board to see how to move forward. Here, we have implemented ‘roll the dice’ feature by pressing the colour button. For example, if you got a five and you were on space number 11, then you would move your game piece to space number 16.\r\n2) Press the highlighted button to get dice value and move piece - Take your turn, press the highlighted button and read the number that you got. Here we have shown, highlighted button for the next move piece. Pick up your game piece and move forward that number of spaces. \r\n3) The ladders on the game board allow you to move upwards and get ahead faster. If you land exactly on a square that shows an image of the bottom of a ladder, then you may move your game piece all the way up to the square at the top of the ladder.\r\n4) If you land exactly at the top of a snake or chute, slide your game piece all the way to the square at the bottom of the snake or chute.\r\n5) As per game rule, if you got a six, then you get an extra turn. First, roll the die again, if we get another six, roll the dice again. If you keep rolling sixes, you can keep moving. But if we get 3 sixes, then it will be treated as zero. Here we have implemented this internally and we need not click the button again, if we get a six. You will get the move value in dice image.\r\n6) Land exactly on the last square to win. The first person to reach the highest square (100) on the board wins. You can only win by getting the exact number needed to land on the last square. Let’s say you are at 98, and we get 3 or more then the piece will bounce back to 98.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDSJF9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Virtual Pet Dragon","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40342.9007199266579144.5b03d2f9-0c02-4b91-b68e-10376227aa2b.1db9db81-38d5-40f0-a4de-1dc99cfd281b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37121.9007199266579144.0dd5cc74-56d1-4e74-9ec4-030bba33082d.3301447d-4507-4620-ab4c-a5b42fb684a2","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $1.29","Price":1.29,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["GlutenFreeGames.VirtualPetDragon_f7c4a2qk8qxct"],"ContentIds":["43b534df-5020-34c3-2a80-f400ff6a1465","7339b01d-7beb-d5ee-b542-20c0289c1c40"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Prepare to take control over the most legendary mythical creature of all time, the Virtual Pet Dragon!

As any other successful game, millions of Solitaire clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with many card laouts in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe game starts with a specific layout and one open card. Rest of the cards are on closed stack. Your aim is to move all the cards to open card. \r\n- You can move any of the open card on the three peaks to the open card if it is adjacent to it regardless of the suit. e.g. you can move a 3 or 5 in case the open card is 4. Either King or 2 can go on top of the Ace (and vice versa). \r\n- If you are unable to move any card you can open a close card. \r\n- Every time you move a card from layout to open card you get points. These points start with 1 for the first time and increase by 1 for subsequent cards. However if you open a close card the streak breaks and the point start from 1 again.

The Tetris game was created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984—the product of Alexey’s computer programming experience and his love of puzzles. In the decades to follow, Tetris became one of the most successful and recognizable  games, appearing on nearly every gaming platform available. This App is based on the classic Tetris, a new development in windows10!\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\n\r\nThe goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of Blocks. The player must rotate, move, and drop the falling Tetriminos inside the Matrix (playing field). Lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and have no empty spaces.\r\n\r\nAs lines are cleared, the level increases and Tetriminos fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging. If the Blocks land above the top of the playing field, the game is over.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NDX4QVSGTVJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"ACA NEOGEO THE LAST BLADE","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1202.13610529295479863.d70c8a98-80e3-4431-9b6b-8583fd6f599d.40c5e913-285c-4fef-99df-65bc5e35f60c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33010.13610529295479863.d3f39bd7-bfdc-46fe-9a56-b7041d936b9d.350d5070-6aba-43bb-b54f-57c9fc348d19","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10686.13610529295479863.10a51295-a771-4f78-aeea-2e80c25ac782.b68a6bd7-95ba-421f-9db2-57d2598b94c8","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51669.13610529295479863.1b26ed43-7d52-4ffa-b837-4b35efea6868.68971f1f-bffe-431e-8671-b6be96c5404e","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63038.13610529295479863.b834227c-b2be-4e1d-95f8-8abc05329e9b.8d9653d6-5d01-4eea-930b-19c5acb40549","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $10.99","Price":10.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["HAMSTERCorporation.ACANEOGEOTHELASTBLADE_7xd3265gdqs6r"],"ContentIds":["52e9ddc8-ef8a-036f-e54c-d177e14076b6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"“THE LAST BLADE” is a fighting game released by SNK in 1997, set in Japan’s Edo period with a roster of unique swordsmen to choose from.\r\nThematically the game is similar to the “SAMURAI SHODOWN\" series, but also features a wealth of innovative systems to set it apart. One such system is the ability to choose between “Power” and “Speed” styles when selecting a character. The “Power” system focuses on high damage while the “Speed” system focuses more on intricate combos and speed. The game also features a unique “Hajiki” ability that allows players to deflect or repel attacks.

Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\r\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.\r\n\r\n*This title is based off the MVS (NEOGEO for arcades) version.
